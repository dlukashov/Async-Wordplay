Async-Wordplay
==============

This is a personal sandbox to develop my node.js, mongo, and mongoose skills, as well as to develop an intuition for best practices with client side MVC, LESS, etc.

Dependencies
------------

- Mongoose: see https://github.com/jonathanKingston/meteor/tree/mongoose/packages/mongoose
  `npm install mongoose  `

 And then copy the package.js and mongoose.js into the package directory.
